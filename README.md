# Music Evolution

Introduction:
We have seen genres of music rise and fall. Once being the sound of the world, seemingly fade away. 
Every decade or generation seem give rise to a new sound or creating a new genre.

I aim to visualise and analyse the development of music over the past 100 years. 

I will provide context behind the shifts of music, contextualizing the shifts though factors such as:

- Changing interests - A party fuelled generation or era that requires a new sound to fit the new hobbies

- Use of drugs, for example;
  - Reggae music and marijuana, the typical sound of reggae is slow and relaxing, much like the effects of the substance associated with the genre. (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/cannabis-the-facts/)
  - Metal music and cocaine/alcohol, the typical sound of metal is energetic and exhilarating, much like the effects of the substance(s) associated with the genre. (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/cocaine/what-are-short-term-effects-cocaine-use)



This project will differ from my previous work, interms of, the process. 
Within this project I will go through the 6 steps of completing a data project:
1) Project planning
2) Data collection
3) Data cleaning
4) Data exploration
5) Data visualisation 
7) Reporting or documenting the project
